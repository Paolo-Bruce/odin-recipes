Yield:
6 slices
-----------------------------------------------------
⅓ cup half-and-half

5 large egg whites

2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar

2 tablespoons brown sugar

¼ teaspoon vanilla extract

¼ teaspoon lemon extract

¼ teaspoon salt

2 tablespoons unsalted butter, or more as needed

6 slices bread

½ cup maple syrup, or to taste

3 tablespoons whipped cream, or to taste
-----------------------------------------------------
Step 1
Combine half-and-half, egg whites, confectioners' sugar, brown sugar, vanilla, lemon extract, and salt in a bowl; 
whip together with a whisk or electric whisk until well blended, about 30 seconds. Pour mixture into a large, flat container.

Step 2
Put one bread slice in the container and flip so it is coated on both sides, almost saturated.

Step 3
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a frying pan over medium heat until sizzling. Add soaked bread slice to the pan; 
you can do more than one depending on the size of the pan. Fry until medium brown and edges are crispy, 
about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Continue cooking in batches, dipping bread and frying, and adding butter as necessary.

Step 4
Serve French toast with maple syrup and add whipped cream on top.
